Generative AI Use Report: 

- use of Concurrent Bag in parallel search 
    In my parellel search function, I am using a ConcurrentBag and ConcurrentQueue to keep track of thread results, 
    I got this from Chat GPT as I was struggling implementing a priority queue like described in class. 
    The AI also therefore modified my parallel for each loop since it needed to add the use of the concurrent queue 

- Identifying an Image file
    I use a small function to identify if  a file is an image that I got from AI, since I couldn't figure out how to do this nicely.
