I used AI in the decryptImage function to change the file name so that the ending 'ENCRYPTED' that was 
added during encryption would not be part of the new output file name 

Also for help using the SK library. I have never used this before so I had some trouble reindexing all the pixels 
back into their correct spot after encryption/decryption. And for generating the random bytes used here.
