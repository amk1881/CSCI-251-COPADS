Used AI to help in generating the square root of a big integer, this was really
tripping me up an causing me to get wrong answers. This was used to help me get the 
factors of a number

I also used AI to help me get the factors of a number, while I was using a similar 
method before, I had some formatting issues with using the BigInteger class that I 
did not anticipate. 

I also used AI to help me figure out what/why the extensions class was necesary 
as it was mentioned to use for the isPossiblyPrime method (since it had 'this' keyword). 

I also used AI to help me list ways I could make my prime generation faster. It told 
me to switch out my parallel for loop for a for each loop, also to stop using a concurrent bag 
like I was and to instead use a list to store results.
